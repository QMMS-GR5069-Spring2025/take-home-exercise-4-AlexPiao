# Homework #5: model deployment 

**Instructions**: Using the F1 dataset, build a predictive model and log it in MLflow and write the ML model predictions into a database.

1. [`20 pts`] Create two (2) new tables in your own fatabse where you'll store the predictions from each model for this exercise. 
2. [`30 pts`] Build two (2) predictive models using MLflow, logging hyperparameters, the model itself, four metrics, and two artifcats. Submit submit your MLflow experiments as part of your assignments
3. [`30 pts`] For each model, store its predictions in the corresponding table you created in your own database.  Ensure you are using your own database to store your predictions.
4. [`20 pts`] Push your code to GitHub upon completion
